# Image Classification with SVM on AWS S3 Data

## Overview

This project involves processing image data from an AWS S3 bucket and training a Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier to distinguish between images of airplanes and ships. The code uses several libraries for data handling, processing, and machine learning.

## Requirements

- Python 3.6 or later
- AWS S3 bucket containing the image data
- An `.env` file with the necessary AWS credentials and region information

## Dependencies

Install the required dependencies using `pip`:

```bash
pip install boto3 python-dotenv numpy numba scikit-learn
Environment Variables
Create a .env file in the project root directory with the following content:

AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=your_access_key_id
AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=your_secret_access_key
AWS_REGION=your_aws_region

Script Details
main.py
The main script performs the following tasks:

AWS Setup:

Loads AWS credentials and region from the .env file.
Sets up the S3 client using boto3.
Data Processing:

Defines the process_image_data_parallel_optimized function to process image data in parallel using numba for optimization.
Fetches image data from specified S3 bucket prefixes.
Processes each image, trims or pads the data to a fixed length, and labels it based on its category (airplane or ship).
Model Training and Evaluation:

Splits the processed data into training and testing sets.
Trains an SVM classifier with a linear kernel.
Evaluates the classifier and prints the accuracy.
Usage
Ensure you have the required AWS S3 bucket and image data structured as follows:

    │       └── planesnetX.jpg
    └── ships/
        └── shipsnet/
            └── shipsnetY.jpg
Create a .env file with your AWS credentials and region.

Run the main.py script:

bash
Copiar código
python main.py
Example Output
The script will print the length of processed image data after trimming and padding, and finally, the accuracy of the classifier:

Copiar código
Result length for image airplanes/planesnet/planesnetX.jpg after adjustment: 1000
Result length for image ships/shipsnet/shipsnetY.jpg after adjustment: 1000
Classifier accuracy: 85.00%
Notes
Adjust max_sequence_length based on the specifics of your image data and processing requirements.
Ensure that your AWS credentials have sufficient permissions to access the specified S3 bucket and objects.

# 📷 Image Classification with SVM on AWS S3 Data

## Overview

Welcome to the Image Classification Project! This project leverages AWS S3 for data storage and a Support Vector Machine (SVM) to classify images of airplanes and ships. 🚀🛳️

## Requirements

- 🐍 Python 3.6 or later
- ☁️ AWS S3 bucket containing the image data
- 🔑 An `.env` file with AWS credentials and region information

## Dependencies

First, make sure to install the necessary Python libraries using `pip`:

```bash
pip install boto3 python-dotenv numpy numba scikit-learn
Environment Variables
Create a .env file in the project root directory with the following content:

makefile
Copiar código
AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=your_access_key_id
AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=your_secret_access_key
AWS_REGION=your_aws_region
Replace your_access_key_id, your_secret_access_key, and your_aws_region with your actual AWS credentials and region.
